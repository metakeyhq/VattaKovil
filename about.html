                    CSI Ebenezer Church is a vibrant Christian community committed to living out the love and teachings of Jesus Christ. Our name, Ebenezer, derived from the Hebrew term meaning "stone of help," reflects our belief that "Thus far the Lord has helped us" (1 Samuel 7:12). This signifies our acknowledgment of God's faithfulness and guidance in our journey of faith.

                        <p>
                            We believe that our true identity is found not in the world, but in Jesus Christ. In Him, we are made new—redeemed, restored, and called to a higher purpose. Each member of our church is cherished as a child of God, uniquely gifted and chosen to shine His light. As we grow in faith, we are reminded that we are no longer defined by our past, but by His promises. Through Christ, we find hope, healing, and wholeness.

                        <p>
                            Church is not just a building—it is a living, breathing family. At CSI Ebenezer Church, we walk together in love, lifting one another up through prayer, support, and genuine fellowship. We rejoice together in times of celebration and stand united in seasons of trial. Just as Christ welcomed all, so we open our arms to every soul seeking belonging. Here, no one walks alone.

                            We are called to live as citizens of heaven, even while on earth. Kingdom Culture is our commitment to reflect the character of Christ in all we do—love, humility, righteousness, and mercy. We seek to build a community that mirrors God’s justice and grace, where service flows from faith and every act is done for His glory. Through worship, outreach, and discipleship, we embody the values of God’s eternal kingdom.

                            Our lives are not guided by our own strength, but by the gentle leading of the Holy Spirit. To be Spirit-led is to surrender daily—to walk by faith, listen for His voice, and trust in His divine plan. The Holy Spirit empowers us to live with courage, compassion, and conviction. At CSI Ebenezer, we encourage every believer to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with God, allowing His Spirit to transform hearts and renew minds.

                        <p>
                            We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ—fully God and fully man—as the cornerstone of our faith. Through His life, death on the cross, and victorious resurrection, He made a way for all to be reconciled to God. In Christ, we receive forgiveness, salvation, and eternal life. He is our living hope, and through Him, we are a new creation, called to reflect His light in a darkened world.

                            We believe the Holy Bible is the inspired, infallible Word of God. It is our guide, our source of truth, and the foundation of all we teach and live. Every page bears witness to God’s love, justice, and redemption. As we read and meditate on Scripture, we are shaped more into the image of Christ and strengthened to walk faithfully in His ways.

It is the Spirit who opens our hearts to the truth, equips us for ministry, and cultivates spiritual fruit within us. We seek to be a Spirit-filled church, open to the movement of God, and led by His divine wisdom in all things.

                            We believe the Church is not merely an institution, but the living body of Christ. As His hands and feet, we are called to love, serve, and bear witness to His kingdom on earth. Every believer has a place in God’s family, gifted and called to build up the Church and reach the world with the Good News. We cherish worship, value fellowship, and commit ourselves to mission and outreach, both locally and globally.
